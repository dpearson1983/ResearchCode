This file is to keep track of things that I need/want to do for the LNKNLogs code

Short term:
    1. Write single tracer code
    2. Setup to run from parameter files as implemented in some of my other code
    3. Put together a makefile
    
Long term:
    1. Look into a more standardized parameter file format (e.g. ini files)
    2. Setup code to be able to generate single or multitracer mocks based on parameter file
       options.
    3. Look into adding in finger-of-god effect to anisotropies.
        - Should be relatively simple with a Lorentzian multiplicative factor
    4. Explore ways of making the anisotropies radial instead of in a single cartesian
       coordinate direction.
        - Easiest way is probably to figure out ways of generating velocities from the
          overdensity field since then RSDs are simply caused by the LOS component.
        - Added bonus: In this method, the lognormal realization would only depend on
          the bias of the desired tracer, which would allow for a mock with redshift
          evolution built in by allowing the bias to change with position.
